# Double List Elements: Instructions

Write a function `double_elements` that doubles all the elements in a list.

* It should take in the list as an argument
* It should return a new list with each element doubled

## Testing

Call your function with a sample list and print the results to check that it's working.

Run the automated tests with `python3 test.py` to check that your solution
works.

If you've never taken a look at the `test.py` file, now might be a good time to
try to read it and see what it's doing. It's loading and running your function,
and checking that return value matches the expected return value.
