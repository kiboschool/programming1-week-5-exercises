# Unit Conversions

For this assignment, you must write 4 functions. Each function should take in a value in one unit, and return a value, converted to the other unit.

`km_to_miles` should accept a value in kilometers, and return a value representing that distance in miles.The conversion formula is miles = kilometers \* 0.621371.

`miles_to_km` should take a value in miles, and return the distance in kilometers. The conversion formula is kilometers = miles / 0.621371.

`lbs_to_kg` should take a value in pounds, and return a value in kilograms.The conversion formula is kilograms = pounds\*0.453592.

`kg_to_lbs` should take a value in kilograms, and return a value in pounds. The conversion formula is pounds = kilograms / 0.453592.

**Make sure to round the conversion results to 2 decimal places.**

## Testing

Test out your functions manually by printing the results.

Then, test your code using the automated tests by running `python3 test_main.py`.
