# Unit Conversions: Instructions  

For this assignment, you must write 4 functions. Each function should take in a value in one unit, and return a value, converted to the other unit.

`km_to_miles` should accept a value in kilometers, and return a value representing that distance in miles.

`miles_to_km` should take a value in miles, and return the distance in kilometers.

`lbs_to_kg` should take a value in pounds, and return a value in kilograms.

`kg_to_lbs` should take a value in kilograms, and return a value in pounds.

## Testing

Test out your functions manually by printing the results.

Then, test your code using the automated tests by running `python3 test.py`.
